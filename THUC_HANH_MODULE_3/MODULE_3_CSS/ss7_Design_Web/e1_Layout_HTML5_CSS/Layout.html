        <p>BUDAPEST, Hungary — Viktor Orbán claimed victory in Hungary’s general election on Sunday,
        as his Fidesz party appears on track to deliver the prime minister a fourth consecutive

        from Brussels,” Orbán said in a speech in front of the Danube river on election night.
        “The whole world has seen tonight in Budapest that Christian democratic politics,
        conservative civic politics and patriotic politics have won."</p>
